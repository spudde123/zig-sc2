# Zig-sc2

Intended to make a Starcraft 2 bot for competing
on [sc2ai.net](https://sc2ai.net/), written in Zig 0.12.
It doesn't at this time use everything in the SC2
[API](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto),
but nothing important for actually making bots should
be missing.

Start from [zig-sc2-template](https://github.com/spudde123/zig-sc2-template) to make your own bot.
